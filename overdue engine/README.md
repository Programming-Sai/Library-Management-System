The system is:
- Offline-first
- Console-based
- Implemented in Java
- Uses only data structures and file storage

File Descriptions

 1. `borrowers.txt`
Stores borrower information in the format:

```

BorrowerID,Name,FineOwed

```

Example:
```

B001,Ama Serwaa,0.0
B002,Kwame Mensah,3.0

```


 2. `transactions.txt`
Stores lending records in the format:

```

ISBN,BorrowerID,BorrowDate,ReturnDate,IsReturned

```

Example:
```

ISBN001,B001,2025-06-10,2025-06-20,false

```


 3. `overdue_report.txt` (Output)
Generated automatically after overdue check. Contains list of overdue items and calculated fines.

Example Output:
```

Overdue Report â€“ 2025-07-10

````


 How It Works

1. Load borrower data from `borrowers.txt`
2. Load active (not returned) transactions from `transactions.txt`
3. For each transaction:
   - Check if return date + 14 days grace period has passed
   - If overdue, calculate fine: **GHS 1.00 per extra day**
   - Add fine to borrower
4. Save:
   - Updated borrower records to `borrowers.txt`
   - Report to `overdue_report.txt`


 How to Run

1. Open terminal in root project folder (`BookLendingSystem/`)
2. Compile Java files:
   ```bash
   Javac src/*.java
````

3. Run program:

   ```bash
   Java -cp src Main
   ```
